# News-Aggregator
 In this project, I developed a News Aggregator application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, integrating the News API to fetch and display real-time news articles. Through this project, I enhanced my understanding of asynchronous JavaScript programming, leveraging async/await for fetching data efficiently and ensuring smooth user interactions.  I learned how to handle and manipulate API data, dynamically display content using DOM manipulation, and create a responsive design for an engaging user experience. The project also improved my ability to work with event listeners for dynamic UI updates, and I explored error handling to manage API request failures gracefully.  This project significantly strengthened my frontend development skills and gave me practical experience in integrating external APIs into a functional and visually appealing application.
